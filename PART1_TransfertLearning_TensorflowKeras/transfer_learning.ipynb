    "1. **Unfreeze and finetune**: As per [Google tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/transfer_learning#fine-tuning) \n",
    ">_Once your model has converged on the new data, you can try to unfreeze all or part of the base model and retrain the whole model end-to-end with a very low learning rate. This is an optional last step that can potentially give you incremental improvements. It could also potentially lead to quick overfitting -- keep that in mind. It is critical to only do this step after the model with frozen layers has been trained to convergence. If you mix randomly-initialized trainable layers with trainable layers that hold pre-trained features, the randomly-initialized layers will cause very large gradient updates during training, which will destroy your pre-trained features. It's also critical to use a very low learning rate at this stage, because you are training a much larger model than in the first round of training, on a dataset that is typically very small. As a result, you are at risk of overfitting very quickly if you apply large weight updates. Here, you only want to readapt the pretrained weights in an incremental way._\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Add **data augmentation** if your model is overfitting. \n",

    "1. If your model is not - unlikely here - , try a more complex model.\n",
